# Gravity Forms IfOnly

Advanced conditional logic for Gravity Forms — group rules with AND/OR logic for fields, buttons, confirmations, and notifications.

## Grouped Conditional Logic

- Create multiple rule groups per field, button, confirmation, or notification
- Rules within a group are evaluated with **AND** logic
- Groups are connected with **OR** logic
- Example: Show field if (Industry **is** Finance **AND** Country **in CSV** Greece,Italy) **OR** (Industry **is** Tech **AND** Email **does NOT contain** .gov)

## Extended Operators

- All standard Gravity Forms operators: is, is not, greater than, less than, contains, starts with, ends with
- **does NOT contain** — show/hide when a field value does not contain a substring
- **in CSV** — match against a comma-separated list of values
- **not in CSV** — exclude matches from a comma-separated list

## Key Features

- **Fields, Buttons & More:** Apply advanced logic to fields, Next button, Submit button, confirmations, and notifications
- **Server-Side Validation:** Logic is re-evaluated on the server during form submission for security and reliability
- **Multilingual:** Works with content in any language
- **Translation-Ready:** All strings are internationalized
- **Secure:** All input is sanitized and escaped — no raw user data rendered
- **GitHub Updates:** Automatic updates from GitHub releases

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.0 or higher
- PHP 8.0 or higher
- Gravity Forms 2.8 or higher

## Installation

1. Upload the `gf-ifonly` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress
3. Open any form in the Gravity Forms editor
4. Select a field and look for the **Advanced Conditional Logic** panel in the field settings

## FAQ

### How does grouped logic work?

Each group contains one or more rules joined by AND. Multiple groups are joined by OR. This lets you express: "Show this field if (A AND B) OR (C AND D)."

### Does this replace the standard Gravity Forms conditional logic?

No. Standard conditional logic continues to work as before. IfOnly adds a separate "Advanced Conditional Logic" panel. If a field has IfOnly logic enabled, it takes priority over standard conditional logic for that field.

### What happens on the server side?

When a form is submitted, IfOnly re-evaluates all advanced logic on the server. Fields hidden by IfOnly logic are skipped during validation — required fields that are hidden won't block submission.

### Does it work with multi-page forms?

Yes. You can use IfOnly logic to show/hide the Next button on multi-page forms.

### Can I customize the operators available?

The `gf_ifonly_operators` filter lets you add or remove operators:

```php
add_filter( 'gf_ifonly_operators', function( $operators ) {
    $operators[] = array( 'key' => 'my_custom_op', 'label' => 'My Operator' );
    return $operators;
} );
```
